# PSLO
The aim of this project is to standardize an existing ontology (PSLO) created by Min‑Jung Yoo, Clément Grozel and Dimitris Kiritsis. Indeed, the Product-Service Lifecycle Ontology model facilitates information retrieval and knowledge extraction during the product lifecycle, while making more information available for the sake of service business creation. The problem we try to fix is the fact that this ontology can't be actually accepted since it was not builded using existing ontology standardized. Our goal is to change this by  using different standardized ontologies like Friend Of A friend(FOAF), Schema.org and The Organization Ontology(TOO) at this point.
